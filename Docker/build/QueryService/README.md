## wdqs docker image

Wikibase specific blazegraph image.

### Upgrading

When upgrading between wdqs versions the data stored in `/wdqs/data` may not be compatible with the newer version.
When testing the new image if no data appears to be loaded into the query service you will need to reload the data.

If all changes are still in RecentChanges then simply removing `/wdqs/data` and restarting the service should reload all data.

If you can not use RecentChanges then you will need to reload from an RDF dump:
 - make an RDF dump from your Wikibase instance: https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-Wikibase/blob/master/repo/maintenance/dumpRdf.php
 - Load an RDF dump into the query service: https://github.com/wikimedia/wikidata-query-rdf/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#load-the-dump

### Filesystem layout

File                              | Description
--------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`/wdqs/whitelist.txt`             | Whitelist file for other SPARQL endpoints
`/wdqs/RWStore.properties`        | Properties for the service
`/templates/mwservices.json`      | Template for MediaWiki services (substituted to `/wdqs/mwservices.json` at runtime)

### Troubleshooting

* The query service is not running or seems to get killed by the OS?
* The image requires more than 2GB of available RAM to start. While being developed the dev machine had 4GB of RAM.

### Development

New versions of this image should be created alongside new versions of wdqs that are used in production for Wikidata.

New releases that are available for images to be created can be found on archiva: https://archiva.wikimedia.org/repository/releases/org/wikidata/query/rdf/service/

When creating a new image RWStore.properties will need to be updated to match the properties used in production at the time the snapshot was being used.

For this reason it is easier to only create new releases for wdqs versions currently being used in Wikidata production.

When creating a new release the WMF Search platform team should be contacted for help syncing the wdqs version and RWStore.properties file.

The process is generally:
 - Create a new directory using a previous one as an example
 - Update the service snapshot that is being fetched
 - Update the CI build by checking the steps in the main README Development section in this repo.
