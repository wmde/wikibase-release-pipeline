# Architecture Decision Records

This directory collects Architecture Decision Records, as outlined by Michael Nygard in his article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

Architecture (understood widely) decisions should be documented in the ADR format.

A template for this repository is provided here: @subpage adr_nnnn

ADRs related to possible changed, superseded or any other outdated decisions should NOT be removed from the directory.
Superseding decisions should reference ADRs they're changing or overriding.

Current ADRs include:

* @subpage adr_0001
* @subpage adr_0002
* @subpage adr_0003
* @subpage adr_0004
