# 1) Use releases.wikimedia.org for hosting release tarballs {#adr_0002}

Date: 2020-12-04

## Status

accepted

## Context

We need to determine a place to host our new release artifacts (tarballs). 
Currently releases are being served by the Extension Distributor and the release branches of the git repositories.

## Github

#### pros: 

- The same framework we use to produce the artifacts (in the current implementation of the release pipeline)
- Minimal effort required.

#### cons:

- Not a WMF/WMDE service
- Needs to use the github frontend or routing with a token to get the artifacts (unless it's made into a release)

## releases.wikimedia.org

#### pros: 

- Unified front for releases of the Wikimedia Foundation.

#### cons:

- Poor documentation (https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Releases.wikimedia.org) for what we are looking for.
- Seemingly bound to puppet/modules/releases repository for configuration
- No direct control, needs negotiation. 
- Does not seem to be hosting any other extensions (ExtensionDistributor seems to be the desired place for these). However, Mediawiki with bundled extensions is released there https://releases.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.35/

## Wikiba.se

#### pros: 

- WMDE owned means direct control
- The official site for Wikibase

#### cons:

- We would need to build something that either pulls the artifacts or gets them uploaded from the pipeline. 
- Effort required is estimated to be high.
- Meant to be a marketing website

## Extension Distributor

#### pros: 

- Seems to be the "goto place" for MediaWiki extensions

#### cons:

- Looking through [the code](https://github.com/wikimedia/labs-tools-extdist) we would need to adapt it to serve our needs which might be undesired.
- Does not align with our needs of simple a hosting space for artifacts.
- Does not support other software than MediaWiki extensions (WDQS, WDQS ui etc.)

1. We can create new tarballs and publish without filing a ticket or speaking to admins
2. WMDE (github.com/wmde) has a free open source plan with Github. WMF (github.com/wikimedia) does not
3. https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000161/extension-distributor-downloads?orgId=1&from=now-5y&to=now

## Decision

* Wikibase release artifacts will be hosted on the WMF-controlled domain https://releases.wikimedia.org/.

## Consequences

* A new release group called `releasers-wikibase` will be created for access to the repository
* An [SRE-Access-Request] will be created, and the hike team members will be added as initial maintainers. The group will be later on expanded to cover other relevant WMDE staff.
* Publishing step of Wikibase release pipeline will be adjusted to publish tarball release artifacts to https://releases.wikimedia.org/wikibase/ (or similar directory - final name to be defined during the implementation).
