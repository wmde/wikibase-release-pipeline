# Wikibase Suite (WBS) Query Service image

The [Wikidata Query Service (WDQS)](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service) provides a way for tools to access Wikibase data, via a SPARQL API. It is based on [Blazegraph](https://github.com/blazegraph/database/wiki/Main_Page).

> 💡 This image is part of [Wikibase Suite (WBS)](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-suite/blob/main/README.md) which provides everything you need to run a Wikibase instance on your own server.

## Requirements

In order to run WDQS, you need:

- at least 2 GB RAM to start WDQS
- MediaWiki/Wikibase instance
- WDQS as server
- WDQS as updater
- WDQS Proxy for public facing setups
- Configuration via environment variables

### MediaWiki/Wikibase instance

We suggest using the [Wikibase image](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/wikibase) because this is the image we run all our tests against. Follow the setup instructions there to get it running.

### WDQS as server

You'll need one instance of the image to execute the actual WDQS daemon started using `/runBlazegraph.sh`.

You can send `GET` requests with your SPARQL query to the WDQS endpoint (following the example below):
`http://wdqs:9999/bigdata/namespace/wdq/sparql?query={SPARQL}`

### WDQS as updater

You'll need one instance of the image to execute the updater started using `/runUpdate.sh`. This polls changes from Wikibase.

### Reverse proxy

By default, WDQS exposes some endpoints and methods that reveal internal details or functionality that might not be intended in every setup, especially when running as a public service. The example below includes a traefik proxy configuration limiting the functionality WDQS exposes.

### Environment variables

Variables in **bold** are required.

## Example

For an integrated Docker Compose example showing how this image is used in the full WBS configuration, see the root [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-suite/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

## Releases

Official releases of this image can be found on [Docker Hub wikibase/wdqs](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/wdqs).

See the [image changelog](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-suite/blob/main/development/images/wdqs/CHANGELOG.md) for release notes. Documentation at previous releases is preserved in the repository under the corresponding [`wdqs@…` tag](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-suite/tags).

## Versioning

This image uses the shared WBS image tag format. See [WBS Versions](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-suite/blob/main/docs/versions.md).

In addition to the standard tags, this image also publishes a tag that includes the bundled WDQS version.

| Tag | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wdqs*WDQS-VERSION* | wdqs0.3.156 | Points to the latest image release containing that WDQS version. |

## Upgrading

When upgrading between WDQS versions, the data stored in `/wdqs/data` may not be compatible with the newer version. When testing the new image, if no data appears to have been loaded into the Query Service, you'll need to reload the data.

If all changes still appear in [RecentChanges], removing `/wdqs/data` and restarting the service should reload all data.

However, [RecentChanges] are periodically purged of older entries, as determined by the MediaWiki configuration [\$wgRCMaxAge](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgRCMaxAge).

If you can't use [RecentChanges], you'll need to reload from an RDF dump:

- [Make an RDF dump from your Wikibase repository using the dumpRdf.php maintenance script.](https://doc.wikimedia.org/Wikibase/master/php/docs_topics_rdf-binding.html)
- [Load the RDF dump into the Query Service](https://github.com/wikimedia/wikidata-query-rdf/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#load-the-dump)

## Internal filesystem layout

Hooking into the internal filesystem can extend the functionality of this image.

| `/wdqs/RWStore.properties`   | Properties for the service                                                                     |
| `/templates/mwservices.json` | Template for MediaWiki services (populated and placed into `/wdqs/mwservices.json` at runtime) |

## Empty-store updater initialization

Before starting, `/runUpdate.sh` checks whether WDQS contains any entities. When WDQS is empty, it initializes the updater checkpoint from the beginning of the UTC day containing the oldest available RecentChanges entry in the configured Wikibase entity namespaces. This allows a freshly installed or previously affected instance to leave a restart loop and import all entities still represented in RecentChanges. If there are no retained RecentChanges entries, it initializes the checkpoint at the beginning of the current UTC day.

The initialization is guarded: if WDQS contains an entity, or if either service check fails or returns an unexpected response, the updater starts normally without changing its checkpoint. Entities no longer represented in RecentChanges require a full reload as described in [Upgrading](#upgrading).
