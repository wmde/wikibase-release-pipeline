# Wikibase Suite

Wikibase Suite is a containerised, production ready [Wikibase](https://wikiba.se) stack, that allows you to self host a knowledge graph similar to Wikidata.

> This document is for people wanting to self host the full Wikibase Suite. If you are looking for documentation about the individual containers provided with Wikibase Suite, head over to https://hub.docker.com/u/wikibase

Wikibase Suite comes with the following services:

- **[Wikibase](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/wikibase)** MediaWiki packaged with the Wikibase extension and other commonly used extensions.
- **Job Runner** The MediaWiki [JobRunner](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Job_queue#Cron) service which uses the same Wikibase container as above.
- **[MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)** Database service for MediaWiki and Wikibase.
- **[Elasticsearch](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/elasticsearch)** Search service used by MediaWiki.
- **[WDQS](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/wdqs)** Wikidata Query Service allowing SPARQL queries.
- **[WDQS Frontend](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/wdqs-frontend)** Web Frontend to run SPARQL queries.
- **[wdqs-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/wdqs-proxy)** A middle layer for WDQS which serves to filter requests and make the service more secure.
- **[WDQS Updater](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual#runUpdate.sh)** Keeps the WDQS data in sync with Wikibase.
- **[Quickstatements](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/quickstatements)** A web based tool to import and manipulate large amounts of data.
- **[Traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik)** A reverse proxy handling TLS termination and ACME certificate renewal.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

#### Hardware

- Network connection with a public IP address
- AMD64 architecture
- 8 GB RAM
- 4 GB free disk space
- Docker 22.0, or greater
- Docker Compose 2.10, or greater

#### Domain Names

You need three DNS records that resolve to your machines IP address.

- Wikibase e.g. "wikibase.mydomain.net"
- QueryService e.g. "query.mydomain.net"
- QuickStatements e.g. "quickstatements.mydomain.net"

> If you just want to run a quick test on a machine that is not accessible from the internet and do not want to bother setting up DNS, you can do so by using the example domain names `*.mydomain.net`. Configure those domain names in your `/etc/hosts` to resolve to 127.0.0.1. Wikibase Suite will then generate self-signed placeholder certificates for https.

### Initial setup

#### Download required files

Checkout the files from Github.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-release-pipeline
git checkout wmde.20
cd wikibase-release-pipeline/example
```

#### Initial Configuration

Make a copy of the [configuration template](./template.env) in `wikibase-release-pipeline/example`

```sh
cp template.env .env
```

Set usernames, passwords and domain names in your newly created `.env` file
according to the instructions in the comments.

#### Start the stack

Run the following command from within `wikibase-release-pipeline/example`

```sh
docker compose up --wait
```

The first start of Wikibase Suite can take a couple of minutes. Wait for your
shell prompt to return.

Congratulations, your Wikibase Suite instance should be up and running. Web
interfaces are available via https (port 443) on the domain names you
configured for Wikibase, WDQS Frontend and Quickstatements.

#### Stopping Wikibase Suite

To stop Wikibase Suite, use `docker compose down`.

#### Resetting Wikibase Suite Configuration

Most values set in `.env` are copied statically into the respective containers
after the first time you run `docker compose up`.

To reset the configuration but keep your existing data:

1. Make any needed changes to the values in the `.env` file copied from
   `template.env` above. NOTE: Do not change `DB_*` values unless you are also
   re-creating the database ([see below](#removing-wikibase-suite-completely-with-all-its-data).
2. Delete your LocalSettings.php from the ./config directory.
3. Remove and re-create Wikibase Suite containers with:

```sh
docker compose down
docker compose up --wait
```

### Configuring your Wikibase Suite
On first launch, Wikibase Suite will create files in the `./config` directory next to your `.env` file and the `docker-compose.yml` and `template.env`. This is the configuration of your Wikibase Suite. You own those files. Backup them in order to create a Wikibase Suite with the same configuration later.

Two of those files are related to MediaWiki itself.

#### config/LocalSettings.php
This file is generated by the [MediaWiki installer
script](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Install.php) and augmented by the
Wikibase containers `entrypoint.sh` on the first launch of Wikibase Suite. Once
this file has been generated, you own it. This means you can make changes, you
even might need to make changes on major version updates. In order to ease
keeping track of your own adjustments vs settings generated by the Wikibase
container, we provide a file called `LocalSettings.override.php`. This file is
the preferred location for your adjustments. See below.

The absence of this file is the trigger for the Wikibase container to run the
[MediaWiki installer
script](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Install.php). So if you need to
run the installer again, just remove the generated `LocalSettings.php` file and
restart your Wikibase Suite.

#### config/LocalSettings.override.php
This file is the location for your MediaWiki and Wikibase customizations. If
you need to regenerate your `LocalSettings.php`, your
`LocalSettings.override.php` is the safe place that is never rewritten, even
when running the [MediaWiki installer
script](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Install.php).

#### config/wikibase-php.ini
This file is a `php.ini` override file, a good place to tune PHP configuration
values. It will be loaded by the Wikibase Webservers PHP interpreter.

### Managing your Wikibase Suite Data
Besides [your configuration](#configuring-your-wikibase-suite), your data is obviously what makes your Wikibase Suite unique. All data is stored in [docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).

 - **wikibase-image-data** MediaWiki image and media uploads.
 - **mysql-data** MariaDB raw database.
 - **wdqs-data** Wikidata Query Service raw database.
 - **elasticsearch-data** Elastic Search raw database.
 - **quickstatements-data** Quickstatement OAuth binding for this MediaWiki instance.
 - **traefik-letsencrypt-data** SSL cerificates.

#### Backup your data

You can backup your data by shutting down the stack and dumping the contents of all volumes into `tar.gz` files.

```sh
docker compose down

for v in \
    wikibase-suite-wikibase_image-data \
    wikibase-suite_mysql-data \
    wikibase-suite_wdqs-data \
    wikibase-suite_elasticsearch-data \
    wikibase-suite_quickstatements-data \
    wikibase-suite_traefik-letsencrypt-data; do
  docker run --rm --volume $v:/backup debian:12-slim tar cz backup > $v.tar.gz
done
```

#### Restore from a data backup

To restore a backup, shut down your stack (in case it is already running) and populate the volumes with data from your `tar.gz` files.

```sh
docker compose down

for v in \
    wikibase-suite-wikibase_image-data \
    wikibase-suite_mysql-data \
    wikibase-suite_wdqs-data \
    wikibase-suite_elasticsearch-data \
    wikibase-suite_quickstatements-data \
    wikibase-suite_traefik-letsencrypt-data; do
  docker volume rm $v 2> /dev/null
  docker volume create $v
  docker run -i --rm --volume $v:/backup debian:12-slim tar xz < $v.tar.gz
done
```


### Updating Wikibase Suite with non breaking Releases

Minor and patch releases are applied automatically when recreating Docker
containers. They do not contain breaking changes and should be always safe to
apply.

```sh
docker compose down 
docker compose up --wait
```

### Prevent updates on Wikibase Suite Restart

If you do not want to pull in any code changes on restart you just stop your containers before restart without removing them.

```sh
docker compose stop 
docker compose up --wait
```

Please note that this will not apply any security updates. It is generally recommended to remove your containers for restart as described above.

### Upgrading to New Major Releases of Wikibase Suite

Always create a backup of your data before attempting a major version update.

Major releases may require additional steps. Refer to specific upgrade instructions in the Migration Guide section below.

### Removing Wikibase Suite Completely with all its data

To reset the configuration and data, and remove the Wikibase Suite Docker containers. _This will destroy all data, make sure to backup anything you wish to retain_:

```sh
docker compose down --volumes
```

It is possible to migrate an existing Wikibase installation to Wikibase Suite. The general procedure would be:

 - [Backup your MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Backing_up_a_wiki)
 - Install Wikibase Suite as [described above](#initial-setup)
 - Re-apply [customization](#customizing-your-wikibase-suite-mediawiki) to LocalSettings.php
 - Import your database dump
 - Regenerate WDQS database

## FAQ

### Can I host Wikibase Suite locally?

Yes, Wikibase Suite can be hosted locally for testing purposes. However, due to OAuth requirements, QuickStatements may not function properly without a publicly accessible domain names for both the `WIKIBASE_PUBLIC_HOST` and `QUICKSTATEMENTS_PUBLIC_HOST`. Running locally without publicly accessible addresses will also not generate a valid SSL certificate so accessing services will require allowing the invalid certificate on first load.

### Do you have any recommended Internet host / VPS provider recommendations?

At this time, there are no specific recommendations for Internet hosts or VPS providers for hosting Wikibase Suite. The suite has been tested on various providers, and as long as the minimum technical requirements are met, it should run as expected.

The provided files are for configuring and deploying Wikibase Suite using Docker containers. Wikibase is an extension for MediaWiki that enables the creation and management of structured data, similar to Wikidata. In addition to this configuration of MediaWiki, Wikibase suite includes the Wikidata Query Service (WDQS), QuickStatements, Elasticsearch, and a reverse proxy with SSL services. The configuration is managed through Docker Compose and environment variables.
