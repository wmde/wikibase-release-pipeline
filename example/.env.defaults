# The dedicated job runner in this configuration restarts itself after every job, to ensure that 
# changes to the configuration are picked up as quickly as possible.

# If you run large batches of edits, this job runner may not be able to keep up with edits.
#
# You can speed it up by setting this variable to a higher number run more jobs between restarts if
# youâ€™re okay with configuration changes not taking effect in the job runner immediately.
# Alternatively, you can run several job runners in parallel by using the `--scale` option.
