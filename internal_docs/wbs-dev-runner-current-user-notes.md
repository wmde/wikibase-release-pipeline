# Notes on Running wbs-dev-runner as current user

A work in progress: I had it mostly working as is, but thought it was unnecessarily complex. The Docker engine I use is using my user for things somehow, so the issue of files created with "root" hasn't came-up for me, but this may be something that needs addressing for other dev teams users. 

./nx script:

```bash
...
docker compose --progress quiet build --build-arg UID="$(id -u)" --build-arg GID="$(id -g)"
exec docker compose --progress quiet run --build --rm runner -c "nx ${*}"
```

./Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Base image: Node.js LTS (20) on Debian Bookworm (12)
FROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS wbs-dev-runner-base

# WBS tests use the Selenium Standalone image, so no need for the embedded Chromium
