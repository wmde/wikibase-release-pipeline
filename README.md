# Wikibase release pipeline

## Repository overview

The wikibase release pipeline contains scripts used for building, testing and publishing Wikibase docker images and tarballs.

It contains a set of build targets defined in the [Makefile](./Makefile) which can be executed in two different ways.

When [building](docs/topics/pipeline.md), use the [build.sh](build.sh) wrapper script to do the building inside a docker-container, this way files aren't littered around the repository but only in the `artifacts/` directory.

For [testing](docs/topics/testing.md), you can use `test`, `test-all` make targets.

## Documentation

The pipeline documentation can be found [here](docs/index.md).
