# Wikibase Suite (WBS)

Wikibase Suite (WBS) is a production-ready Wikibase software bundle that allows you to self-host a public knowledge graph similar to Wikidata. It includes MediaWiki, Wikibase, QuickStatements, Query Service, and an SSL certificate for your public instance.

**What's Included**

- Wikibase and MediaWiki for creating and managing structured linked data.
- Query Service and Query Service UI for SPARQL queries.
- Query Service Updater to keep query data in sync.
- QuickStatements for batch imports and edits.
- Reverse-proxy service (Traefik) for routing your domain names to Wikibase and the Query Service UI.
- Required services: job runner, database (MariaDB), and search server (OpenSearch).

## WBS Docker Images

WBS uses a set of published Docker images which can also be used independently. See [Wikibase Suite (WBS) Docker Images](./docs/docker-images.md) for their configuration options and release notes.

## Development

Image sources and the build, integration-test, and release tooling are maintained in [`development/`](./development/README.md). Most WBS users do not need these tools. They are available for contributors and advanced users who want to build customized images.
