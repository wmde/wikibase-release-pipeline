# Wikibase Suite (WBS) development

This development area contains the build, integration-test, and release tooling for Wikibase Suite. It is for contributors and advanced users building customized images; it is not required to install or operate WBS with the published images.

The installable product configuration and user documentation live at the [repository root](../README.md).

## Getting started

Development requires Git and a current Docker installation with the Compose and Buildx plugins. Node.js, pnpm, Python, and the repository linters do not need to be installed on the host.

Repository tasks run through `wbs-dev`. The wrapper builds or loads the development-tooling image and runs the TypeScript task coordinator in that container. The checkout is mounted into the container, while image builds and test services use the host Docker daemon. GitHub Actions uses the same entry point and underlying scripts.

The container keeps its Linux `node_modules` installations in named Docker volumes. This leaves any host-side pnpm installation untouched, so contributors can also use the Node version declared in `.nvmrc` for direct editor and package-manager integration. Dependency volumes are refreshed automatically when the package manifest, lockfile, workspace configuration, or pnpm version changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Development commands in this documentation use `wbs-dev`. Add the checkout's `wikibase-suite/development` directory to your shell's `PATH` to use that form from any working directory. Without changing `PATH`, run the same commands as `./wbs-dev` from `wikibase-suite/development`, or as `development/wbs-dev` from the repository root.

For example, add the absolute path for your checkout to your shell configuration:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/wikibase-suite/development"
```

```bash
wbs-dev build
wbs-dev test
wbs-dev lint
```

## Running a Suite instance

Use the repository-root `.env` and Compose configuration to run Wikibase Suite as an installed user would:

```bash
./wbs up --build
./wbs status
./wbs down
```

`wbs up --build` builds every WBS product image from the current checkout, selects the local-image Compose override, and starts the Suite without pulling published product images. Use `./wbs up --update` without the development option to update and start the configured published images.

When the repository-root `.env` is missing or incomplete, interactive `wbs up` resumes the command-line configurator. Existing values become prompt defaults and existing passwords can be retained without displaying them. An existing `.env` remains the configuration base; template values are used only when creating a new configuration. With `--build`, the configurator supplies local host, administrator, and database defaults for values that are still missing.

Optional repository-root `local.env` values override `.env` when lifecycle commands run Docker Compose. The configurator continues to own `.env` and never modifies `local.env`. The WBS host runner sources this trusted, shell-compatible file before preparing the tools image. Developers running a complete source installation on ARM can set `WBS_SKIP_ARCH_CHECK=true` without changing the supported installer defaults; ordinary lifecycle commands do not perform the installer's architecture preflight.

The `development/wbs` lifecycle commands are an internal, experimental development interface. They are intentionally absent from the repository root and are not documented as an end-user operations feature yet.
The development launcher uses `wikibase/wbs-tools:latest` from the checkout rather than pulling the published compatible-major image. On first use it builds that local tools image when it is missing; after tools-application changes, rebuild it explicitly with `wbs-dev build wbs-tools`.

The current local profile uses `wikibase.test` and `query.wikibase.test`. The configurator prints the hosts-file entry needed when those names do not already resolve locally. Local DNS and certificate handling remain separate from image and lifecycle selection.

Compose files are applied in this order: the root `docker-compose.yml`, the development local-image override when selected, and the optional root `docker-compose.local.yml` last. This allows checkout-specific customizations to override either image mode.

Use `./wbs reset` to reset the development instance. It asks independently whether to delete the generated `.env` configuration and whether to delete services, volumes, data, and generated runtime files. Repository-root `local.env` is always preserved. A data reset leaves the Suite stopped; run `./wbs up` explicitly when you want to start it again. Use `--force` only for automation when both configuration and data should be deleted. The deleted state is described in the user-facing [reset documentation](../docs/operate/reset.md).

For exploratory work inside an integration-test environment instead, start exactly one named suite with `--setup`:

```bash
wbs-dev test repo --setup
```

This builds the test images, starts that suite's test-only services and fixtures, and leaves the environment running without executing its specifications. It is test infrastructure rather than an alternative product lifecycle command.

## Developing the browser installer

Start the browser installer with live reload from the current checkout:

```bash
wbs-dev installer-dev web
```

This builds the local Suite images, uses local test domains, and runs the normal host launch scripts, so following the regular installer actions performs a real Suite installation.

For UI and UX work without starting services, use mock mode:

```bash
wbs-dev installer-dev web --mock
```

Mock mode uses the same live development server, makes the progress steps clickable, and runs normal form validation. Starting installation emits an accelerated, realistic installation log through the completed screen, but does not write configuration, signal the host launch scripts, or start Suite services. Without `--mock`, the progress steps are not skippable and the installer retains its real end-to-end behavior.

Use `wbs-dev --help` or `wbs-dev <command> --help` for the current targets, options, and examples.

Contribution expectations are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Local configuration

Put optional local overrides in `development/local.env`. The `wbs-dev` wrapper creates the file when it is missing. Test defaults come from the root `.env.example`, `development/tests/test-services.env`, and `development/tests/test-runner.env`.

If parallel browser-test workers exhaust local CPU or memory, set `WBS_TEST_MAX_INSTANCES=1` in `development/local.env`. This caps every suite without changing its CI defaults.

See the [integration test guide](./tests/README.md#environment-and-local-overrides) for test-specific variables.

## Linting

`wbs-dev lint` applies one shared JavaScript and TypeScript correctness baseline, with scoped additions for Node.js, Vue, Mocha, and WebdriverIO execution environments. Prettier remains an explicit formatting option through `wbs-dev lint --fix --prettier`; formatting is not part of the default lint check.

The repository does not currently contain JavaScript owned by WBS that runs as Wikibase or MediaWiki extension code. Upstream extension source is excluded because it belongs to its source project. If extension JavaScript is added here later, keep it in an explicit source directory and add a scoped Wikimedia ESLint configuration for that directory rather than applying Wikimedia rules to the development tools, installer, or integration tests.

- [`docker-compose.local-images.yml`](./docker-compose.local-images.yml): product override selecting images built from the current checkout

Canonical image usage documentation is indexed in [WBS Docker Images](../docs/docker-images.md) and maintained beside each image's source.
