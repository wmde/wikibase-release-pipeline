### Development

New releases available for image creation can be found on Archiva: https://archiva.wikimedia.org/repository/releases/org/wikidata/query/rdf/service/

When creating a new image, you may need to update RWStore.properties to match the properties used in Wikidata production.

Thus it's easier to create new releases for WDQS versions that have been tested in Wikidata production.

When creating a new release, you can reach out to the WMF Search platform team for help syncing the wdqs version and RWStore.properties file.
