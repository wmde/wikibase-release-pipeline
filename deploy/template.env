# be set on an existing database, nor will MediaWiki update those settings in
# your LocalSettings.php. To change those settings, either adjust them manually
# in MariaDB and your LocalSettings.php, or delete your MariaDB volume
# "mysql-data" and your LocalSettings.php from the ./config directory and
# restart.
