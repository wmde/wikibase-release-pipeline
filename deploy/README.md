# Wikibase Suite Deploy

Wikibase Suite (WBS) Deploy is a containerized, production-ready [Wikibase](https://wikiba.se) system that allows you to self-host a knowledge graph similar to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). In addition to Wikibase on MediaWiki, WBS Deploy includes the Wikidata Query Service (WDQS) and its front end, along with QuickStatements, Elasticsearch and a Traefik reverse proxy with SSL termination and ACME support. The service orchestration is implemented using Docker Compose V2.

> 🔧 This document is for people wanting to self-host the full Wikibase Suite using Wikibase Suite Deploy. If you are looking for individual WBS images, head over to [hub.docker.com/u/wikibase](https://hub.docker.com/u/wikibase).

> 💡 This document presumes familiarity with basic Linux administration tasks and with Docker and Docker Compose.

## What's in the box?

WBS Deploy consists of the following services:

- **[Wikibase](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/wikibase)** MediaWiki packaged with the Wikibase extension and other commonly used extensions.
- **Job Runner** The MediaWiki [JobRunner](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Job_queue#Cron) service which uses the same Wikibase container as above.
- **[MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)** Database service for MediaWiki and Wikibase.
- **[Elasticsearch](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/elasticsearch)** Search service used by MediaWiki.
- **[WDQS](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/wdqs)** Wikidata Query Service to process SPARQL queries.
- **[WDQS Frontend](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/wdqs-frontend)** Web front end for SPARQL queries.
- **[WDQS Updater](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual#runUpdate.sh)** Keeps the WDQS data in sync with Wikibase.
- **[Quickstatements](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/quickstatements)** A web-based tool to import and manipulate large amounts of data.
- **[Traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik)** A reverse proxy that handles TLS termination and SSL certificate renewal through ACME.

### Requirements

#### Hardware

- Network connection with a public IP address
- AMD64 architecture
- 8 GB RAM
- 4 GB free disk space

#### Software

- Docker 22.0 (or greater)
- Docker Compose 2.10 (or greater)
- git

#### Domain names

You need two DNS records that resolve to your machine's IP address:

- Wikibase, e.g., "wikibase.example"
- QueryService, e.g., "query.wikibase.example"

## Setup

> 💡 If you want to run a quick test on a machine that has no public IP address (such as your local machine), check our [FAQ entry](#can-i-host-wbs-deploy-locally) below.

### Download WBS Deploy

Check out the files from Github, move to the subdirectory `deploy`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-release-pipeline
cd wikibase-release-pipeline/deploy
```

### Initial configuration

Make a copy of the [configuration template](./template.env) in the `wikibase-release-pipeline/deploy` directory.

```sh
cp template.env .env
```

Follow the instructions in the comments in your newly created `.env` file to set domain names, usernames and passwords.

### Starting

Run the following command from within `wikibase-release-pipeline/deploy`:

```sh
docker compose up
```

The first start can take a couple of minutes. You can check the status of the stack by running `docker ps` from another terminal. When your WBS Deploy instance is ready, the `wbs-deploy-wikibase-1` container will be marked `healthy`.

🎉 Congratulations! You can now access your instance via https://wikibase.example. Make sure to adjust your domain name accordingly.

> 💡 If anything goes wrong, you can run `docker logs <CONTAINER_NAME>` to see some helpful error messages.

### Stopping

To stop, use

```sh
docker compose stop
```

### Resetting the configuration

Most values set in `.env` are written into the respective containers after you run `docker compose up` for the first time.

If you want to reset the configuration while retaining your existing data:

1. Make any needed changes to the values in `.env`.
   NOTE: Do not change `DB_*` values unless you are also [re-creating the database](#removing-wikibase-suite-completely-with-all-its-data).
2. Remove your `LocalSettings.php` file from the `deploy/config` directory. (Create a backup if you made any changes.)
3. Remove and re-create containers:

```sh
docker compose down
docker compose up
```

## Advanced configuration

On first launch, WBS Deploy will create files in the `deploy/config` directory. This is your instance configuration. **You own and control these files.** Be sure to include them in your backups.

### `config/LocalSettings.php`

This file is generated by the [MediaWiki installer script](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Install.php) and supplemented by the Wikibase container's `entrypoint.sh` script on first launch. Once this file has been generated, you own and control it. You may _need_ to make changes to it for [MediaWiki major version updates](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Upgrading#Adapt_your_LocalSettings.php).

If `config/LocalSettings.php` is missing, it triggers the Wikibase container to run the [MediaWiki installer script](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Install.php). If you need to run the installer again, you can remove the `deploy/config/LocalSettings.php` file (but keep a backup just in case!) and restart your instance.

### `config/wikibase-php.ini`

This is Wikibase's `php.ini` override file, a good place for tuning PHP configuration values. It gets loaded by the Mediawiki Wikibase web server's PHP interpreter.

### `config/wdqs-frontend-config.json`

This configuration file allows you to control `wdqs-frontend`, the GUI for the query service.

### User-defined extensions

It is possible to add extensions to Wikibase Suite Deploy's MediaWiki. To learn how this works, consult the [README in `deploy/config/extensions`](./config/extensions/README.md).

### docker-compose.yml

To further customize your instance, you can also make changes to `docker-compose.yml`. To ease updating to newer versions of WBS Deploy, consider putting your customizations into a new file called, for example, `docker-compose.override.yml`. If you do this, you'll need to start using the following commands to restart your instance:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up
```

This way, your changes are kept separate from the original WBS Deploy code.

## Managing your data

Besides [your configuration](#advanced-configuration), it's your data that makes your instance unique. All instance data is stored in [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).

- `wikibase-image-data`: MediaWiki image and media file uploads
- `mysql-data`: MediaWiki/Wikibase MariaDB raw database
- `wdqs-data`: Wikidata Query Service raw database
- `elasticsearch-data`: Elasticsearch raw database
- `quickstatements-data`: generated Quickstatements OAuth binding for this MediaWiki instance
- `traefik-letsencrypt-data`: Traefik SSL certificates generated by letsencrypt

### Back up your data

To back up your data, shut down the instance and dump the contents of all Docker volumes into `.tar.gz` files.

```sh
docker compose down

for v in \
    wbs-deploy_wikibase-image-data \
    wbs-deploy_mysql-data \
    wbs-deploy_wdqs-data \
    wbs-deploy_elasticsearch-data \
    wbs-deploy_quickstatements-data \
    wbs-deploy_traefik-letsencrypt-data \
    ; do
  docker run --rm --volume $v:/backup debian:12-slim tar cz backup > $v.tar.gz
done
```

### Restore from a backup

To restore the volume backups, ensure your instance has been shut down by running `docker compose down` and populate the Docker volumes with data from your `.tar.gz` files.

```sh
docker compose down

for v in \
    wbs-deploy_wikibase-image-data \
    wbs-deploy_mysql-data \
    wbs-deploy_wdqs-data \
    wbs-deploy_elasticsearch-data \
    wbs-deploy_quickstatements-data \
    wbs-deploy_traefik-letsencrypt-data \
    ; do
  docker volume rm $v 2> /dev/null
  docker volume create $v
  docker run -i --rm --volume $v:/backup debian:12-slim tar xz < $v.tar.gz
done
```

## Updating and versioning

WBS uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). WBS Deploy and each WBS image have individual version numbers.

WBS Deploy always references the latest minor and patch releases of the compatible WBS images' major versions using the Docker images' major version tag. For example, WBS Deploy 2.0.1 might reference `wikibase/wikibase:3`, a tag that always points to the latest image Wikibase 3.x.x image.

#### Minor and patch updates for WBS images

Because WBS Deploy always references the latest minor and patch releases of compatible WBS images, non-breaking changes (including security updates) can be pulled at any time.

This is always safe to do. Simply run:

```sh
docker compose down
docker compose pull
docker compose up
```

> 💡 In order to automatically update images on every start, you can also use `docker compose up --pull always` to start your WBS Deploy stack.

If you installed User Defined Extensions in `config/extensions`, they might have updates too. Make sure to update them regularly too. See [User Defined Extension Docs](./config/extensions/README.md) for more information.

### Minor and patch updates for WBS Deploy

WBS Deploy versions are tagged in git with tags such as `deploy@2.0.1`. Switching to a tag with the same major version will never trigger breaking changes. These updates are **always** considered safe. If you made no changes to `docker-compose.yml`, you may update simply by switching the git tag.

```sh
git remote update
git checkout deploy@2.0.2
```

> 💡 If you made any changes to `docker-compose.yml`, commit them. Merge with upstream changes as you see fit.

### Major upgrades

Major version upgrades are performed by updating WBS Deploy's major version. This is done by changing your git checkout to the new major version tag. This may reference new major versions of WBS images and involve breaking changes. In turn, those may require additional steps as described below.

WBS only supports updating from one major version to the next version in sequence. In order to upgrade from 1.x.x to 3.x.x, you must first upgrade from 1.x.x to 2.x.x and then to 3.x.x.

#### Bring down your instance

```sh
docker compose down
```

#### Back up your data and config

[Create a backup](#backup-your-data) of your data.

Back up your `./config` directory as well using:

```
cp -r ./config ./config-$(date +%Y%M%d%H%M%S)
```

#### Switch to new version

WBS Deploy versions are tagged, such as `deploy@2.0.0` or `deploy@3.0.3`. To update, switch to a more recent tag.

```sh
git remote update
git checkout deploy@3.0.3
```

> 💡 If you made changes to `docker-compose.yml`, merge them as you see fit.

#### Apply any changes to .env

Look for changes in the new `template.env` that you might want to apply to your `.env` file.

#### Apply any migrations for your version

<details><summary><strong>WBS Deploy 3.x.x to 4.x.x</strong></summary><p>

Wikibase Image switched from version 3.x.x to 4.x.x; this upgrades MediaWiki from 1.42 to 1.43. Please read the [MediaWiki UPGRADE file](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/core/+/refs/heads/REL1_43/UPGRADE).

Note that URLs changed with Deploy 4 to the following defaults:
- https://wikibase.example MediaWiki with Wikibase extension
- https://wikibase.example/w/rest.php MediaWiki REST API including Wikibase REST API
- https://query.wikibase.example Front end for WDQS (Query GUI)
- https://query.wikibase.example/sparql SPARQL API endpoint for WDQS
- https://wikibase.example/tools/quickstatements QuickStatements tool

Note that the `wdqs-proxy` image has been removed. Routing of WDQS HTTP traffic is now done by central Traefik.

Note that `wdqs-frontend` environment variables changed. Read more on https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-release-pipeline/tree/main/build/wdqs-frontend#environment-variables

</p></details>

<details><summary><strong>WBS Deploy 2.x.x to 3.x.x</strong></summary><p>

Read the [MediaWiki UPGRADE file](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/core/+/refs/heads/REL1_42/UPGRADE).

No Wikibase-specific migrations are necessary.

Read the [MediaWiki UPGRADE file](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/core/+/refs/heads/REL1_41/UPGRADE).

No Wikibase-specific migrations are necessary.

</p></details>

#### Apply updates to User Defined Extension

If you installed User Defined Extensions in `config/extensions`, they might require updates in order to be compatible with the new MediaWiki version too. See [User Defined Extension Docs](./config/extensions/README.md) for more information.

#### Bring your instance back up

```
docker compose up
```

### Automatic updates

At the moment, WBS Deploy does not support automatic updates. To automatically deploy minor and patch updates including security fixes to your WBS images, [restart your instance](#minor-and-patch-updates-for-wbs-service-containers) on a regular basis with a systemd timer, cron job, or similar.

### Downgrades

Downgrades are not supported. In order to revert an update, restore your data from a backup made prior to the upgrade.

### Removing Wikibase Suite Completely with all its Data

‼️ **This will destroy all data! [Back up](#back-up-your-data) anything you wish to retain.**

To reset the configuration and data, remove the Docker containers, Docker volumes and the generated `deploy/config` files.

```sh
docker compose down --volumes
rm -vf config/{LocalSettings.php,wikibase-php.ini,wdqs-frontend-config.json}
```

Removing the `traefik-letsencrypt-data` volume will request a new certificate from LetsEncrypt on the next launch of your instance. Certificate generation on LetsEncrypt is [rate-limited](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/); eventually you may be blocked from generating new certificates **for multiple days**. To avoid that outcome, change to the LetsEncrypt staging server by appending the following line to the `traefik` `command` stanza of your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.caserver=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

## WDQS

To interact with the WDQS via the web front end, navigate to the URL defined as `WDQS_PUBLIC_HOST` in the `.env` file. By default, this is set to `query.wikibase.example`.

Alternatively, send `GET` requests with your SPARQL query to the WDQS API endpoint: `https://query.wikibase.example/sparql?query={SPARQL}`

## FAQ

### Can I host WBS Deploy locally?

Yes, WBS Deploy can be hosted locally for testing purposes by using the example domain names `*.example` from `template.env` in your `.env` file. Configure those domains in your host machine's `/etc/hosts` file, so that your browser (on your host machine) resolves `*.example` to `127.0.0.1` and access the local WBS Deploy instance.

However, due to OAuth requirements, QuickStatements may not function properly without publicly accessible domain name for `WIKIBASE_PUBLIC_HOST`. Also, running locally without publicly accessible addresses will prevent the generation of a valid SSL certificate; to accessing locally running services, you will need to allow the invalid certificate when loading the page for the first time.

### Can I migrate from another Wikibase installation to WBS Deploy?

It is possible to migrate an existing Wikibase installation to WBS Deploy. The general procedure is as follows:

- [Back up your MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Backing_up_a_wiki)
- [Install Wikibase Suite](#initial-setup) as described above
- Re-apply any [changes](#customizing-your-wikibase-suite-mediawiki) to `config/LocalSettings.php`
- Import your database dump
- Regenerate the WDQS database
- Regenerate the Elasticsearch database

### My WDQS Updater keeps crashing, what can I do?

Check out the known issue in the [WDQS README](../build/wdqs/README.md#Known-issues). You may find your solution there in the form of a workaround.

### Do you recommend any VPS hosting providers?

As of this writing, we can offer no specific recommendations for VPS providers to host Wikibase Suite. The suite has been tested successfully on various providers; as long as the [minimum technical requirements](#hardware) are met, it should run as expected.

### Where can I get further help?
