Wikibase Suite Deploy Setup Tool

The Wikibase Suite Deploy Setup Tool is a lightweight, zero-configuration installer for quickly launching a full Wikibase Suite instance on any fresh VPS. Designed for ease and speed, it combines a one-liner install script with a web-based configuration interface and automatic environment setup. No Docker, DNS, or manual file editing is required upfront â€” everything is generated or guided in-browser.

Features

- One-liner install via curl | bash or cloud-init script
- Browser-based setup interface on port 8888 with live logs
- Optional custom hostnames which otherwise default to <SERVER-IP>.nip.io names
- Auto-generated secure passwords
- Optional opt-in to list your instance with the Wikibase community, with a default of true
- Clean shutdown of setup utility after installation completes (10 min timeout), including removal of passwords from .env

Steps to Launch a New Wikibase Suite Deploy Instance

1. Provision a VPS with the minimum recommended specification or greater
2. SSH in to your new VPS instance as root user and copy/paste this command:

    `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wmde/wikibase-release-pipeline/refs/heads/deploy-setup-script/deploy/setup/setup.sh | bash`

3. Open the setup URL printed in the terminal once prompted
4. On the webpage enter your MediaWiki admin email, base host name, and whether to advertise your instance. Advanced options also available, such as manually setting database password, etc.
5. Click Save, and wait for services to boot
