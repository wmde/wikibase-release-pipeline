## Updating Existing Wikibase 

This guide will help you update your current Wikibase to use the new Federated Statements feature which is in its Alpha Version. If you need to install a fresh Wikibase to try out the feature, please refer to our [other installation guide](./README.md).

### 1. Taking down your current instance

In order to take down your current Wikibase instance, you will need to SSH into your server. Once you've done that, run:

```sh
docker compose down
```

### 2. Pulling new changes to install the feature

```sh
git checkout test-alpha-deployment
```

### 3. Restart your instance

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

The first start may take a couple of minutes. You can check the status of the stack by running `docker ps` from another terminal. When your WBS Deploy instance is ready, the `wbs-deploy-wikibase-1` container will be marked `healthy`.

Your instance is now ready! It will already have the new feature ready for you to try 🎉

> [!NOTE]
> If anything goes wrong, you can run `docker logs <CONTAINER_NAME>` to see some helpful error messages. Should you run into some issues in this step, make sure to [reset the configuration](#resetting-the-configuration) after you fix the error.
